=========

Automacs execution is controlled entirely by text files which hold :ref:`experiments <customize_experiments>`

Users interact with automacs codes with an overloaded Makefile designed to make it easy to run commands from the terminal without a system-level program installation or the annoying use of ./executable.sh to run commands. Instead, users run commands like make help and the Makefile routes the commands to a few python scripts in the amx folder.

Makefile is standard on linux systems, most of which also have tab-completion. Users can hit <tab> twice after make to see many of the utility functions that automacs provides. We will describe these in detail in the remainder of the section.
